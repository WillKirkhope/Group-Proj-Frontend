## Open Village ##

- Open Village is a meet up app intended to help people research community Service events in their local area.
- We have the modern solution to the problem of getting community service events started and staffed! Every community needs help, services that need to be done. Trash pick up, help the elderly, general community service, but getting groups together and a better interface for people to connect on these projects is a tall task.

Our App will help by linking community members into groups to assign tasks and create a network to facilitate completion of these task in a quick and clean manner.

Members can link up, see events, sign up for events, and connect with other members to get these tasks started. Our app acts as an interface to get a group of people together for said Community Service events.

- If you are checking out our code, you will need to run an npm install for dependencies.
- We built our Frontend with Vue, Firebase, and Google Maps.
